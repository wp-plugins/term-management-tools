Allows you to merge terms and set term parents in bulk

== Description ==

If you need to reorganize your tags and categories, this plugin will make it easier for you. It adds two new options to the Bulk Actions dropdown on term management pages:

* Merge - combine two or more terms into one
* Set parent - set the parent for one or more terms (for hierarchical taxonomies)

It works with tags, categories and [custom taxonomies](http://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Taxonomies).

You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

1. Unzip the "term-management-tools" archive and put the folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
